# Design Handoff Project

The task was to, in cooperation with a UX Design Student, transform a design for a fitness club into code using React and several third-party libraries of our choice. The site also needed to be translated into at least one other language.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation

Since I didn't have the design when I started on the project, I first installed all the required dependencies, as well as the dependencies for Styled Components, react-i18next and Day.js. I chose to work with Day.js instead of Moment.js for two reasons. First, I have already tried Moment.js at an other time, and second, I wanted to try and keep the file size of the project to a minimum.

### Deployment to Netlify

I deployed the project right away to allow the UX Designer Linnea Pettersson to view it from her end, in review purposes. The link can be found further down.
